## Subdomain and Directory Enumeration

The script will use a list of potential word sand prepends them to the domain name provided via a command-line argument to find potential subdomains or directories.
The script uses DNS requests to enumerate potential subdomains

## MAC Address spoofing

Since it is not possible for us to manually change the MAC Address every time, we can automate the process of changing the MAC Address using Python. So that we just have to provide the script with the interface name and the new MAC Address.

## Keylogger

The script monitors a client's keystrokes and sends this data to the hacker's machine.
Firstly, we need to execute **server.py** file on the hackers machine. Then execute **client.py** on the clients machine, to monitor a client's keystrokes and sends this data to the hacker's machine.

## Port Scanner

The port scanner script will try to connect on every port list you define. Then script grab service banners on open ports.

## SSH Bruteforcing
## Hash Cracker
## DDOS Script
